* About the directory
This directory was created to test hiwiki equations in Hindi. I had a successful script for that and tested. I do not know wether that is working now.

** Before making changes (Testing script for writing equations):
#+begin_src shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanjeevphys/mathHindi/master/mathscript.js
emacs -nw mathscript.js
git config --global user.email "------r@----.--"
git config --global user.email "Sanjeev Kumar"
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/sanjeevphys/mathHindi.git
git push -u origin master
#+end_src
username and password
